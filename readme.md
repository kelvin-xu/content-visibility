# Block Visibility

Decide when, where, and to whom to show each block on every page of your WordPress site.

Block Visibility provides a set of controls to say whether a block should be shown to users who are signed in to your site or not. Additional add-ons provide controls for **role-based** visibility and **time-based** visibility.

## Individual Block Controls

Every individual block on all posts and pages on your site can have their own controls. Mix and match the visibility of blocks on a single page. Need some blocks to show to everyone and a few to only be available to your site's subscribers? No problem. Only want a message to appear on Christmas Day? You got it. Only want those who are signed in to your site to see certain pieces of content? Easy peasy.

## At a glance

An icon next to each block with active rules allows your content authors to see which blocks may or may not be shown to certain audiences at a glance.

## Reusable blocks

Use Reusable Blocks? No problem, Block Visibility handles those too.

## Coming Soon

 - [ ] Make block visibility controls available on public Custom Post Types by default
 - [ ] Ensure this works with the new 'widgets' screen (controls appear but functionality is currently blocked by [this gutenberg bug](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27173))
 - [ ] REST API exploration. Should be fine for non-authenticated requests, but need to dive deeper for auth'd requests
 - [ ] Non-trivial dates. Think things like "Every Wednesday between 3pm and 4pm" or "First two weeks in November"
 - [ ] Geolocation: Show this block only to users whose connection is in France
 - [ ] Specific Users: Only show a block when a specific user is signed in
 - [ ] Do you have any feature requests? [Let me know!](https://github.com/richardtape/block-visibility/issues/new)
