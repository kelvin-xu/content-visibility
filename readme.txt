Decide when, where, and to whom your blocks are visible.

== Description ==

Content Visibility provides a set of controls to say whether each discrete piece of content (or 'block' in WordPress parlance) should be shown to users who are signed in to your site or not. Additional add-ons provide controls for **role-based** visibility and **time-based** visibility.

## Individual Block Controls

Every individual block on all posts and pages on your site can have their own controls. Mix and match the visibility of blocks on a single page. Need some blocks to show to everyone and a few to only be available to your site's subscribers? No problem. Only want a message to appear on Christmas Day? You got it. Only want those who are signed in to your site to see certain pieces of content? Easy peasy.

## At a glance

An icon next to each block with active rules allows your content authors to see which blocks may or may not be shown to certain audiences at a glance.

## Reusable blocks

Use Reusable Blocks? No problem, Content Visibility handles those too.

## Coming Soon

 - [ ] Make content visibility controls available on public Custom Post Types by default
 - [ ] Ensure this works with the new 'widgets' screen (controls appear but functionality is currently blocked by [this gutenberg bug](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27173))
 - [ ] REST API exploration. Should be fine for non-authenticated requests, but need to dive deeper for auth'd requests
 - [ ] Non-trivial dates. Think things like "Every Wednesday between 3pm and 4pm" or "First two weeks in November"
 - [ ] Geolocation: Show this block only to users whose connection is in France
 - [ ] Specific Users: Only show a block when a specific user is signed in
 - [ ] Do you have any feature requests? [Let me know!](https://github.com/richardtape/content-visibility/issues/new)
