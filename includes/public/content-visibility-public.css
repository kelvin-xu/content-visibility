/*
    Widgets are weird. They have their own rules. And no generic filter. It's a bit of a Wild West as plugins can do
    whatever they want. And, as The Block Editor now treats widgets as blocks (and vice versa), for Back Compat, (which
    is the right thing to do) we get little foibles like this.

    Widgets can be hidden using Content Visibility rules. However, unfortunately, the container for the widget that is
    being hidden, doesn't appear to be *consistently* manipulatable. So, if the widget container is empty, we need to
    hide it. Loading an entire file for one selector makes me pull a funny face (which is why I've made the file
    as easy to not load as I can with a filter).
