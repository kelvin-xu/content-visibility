Thanks to Helen Hou-Sandi and the 10-up folks for the github -> wordpress.org deploy action. Freaking cool. https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy

Thanks to Helen - again - and all of the women and those who identify as non-binary who lead the 5.6 release of WordPress. Not least because it includes some APIs which allow me to improve this plugin over time.

Thanks to Mika E and the other plugin repo review team folks for everything you do there.

Thank you to Timothy Jacobs who has jumped into many a rabbit hole with me over the past 24 months, helping me find the relevant filters and actions, and APIs before they had fleshed-out documentation.
Also, thank you to Darren Ethier for his excellent blog posts series including one on data within the block editor.
And finally for the direct coding thank yous, to Chris van Patten for digging into an issue which was stopping things working as expected for all blocks.

Thanks to Flynn O'Connor, Jeremy Felt, and Stephen Locker for listening to me bang on about this for about 2 years and providing encouragement and motivation to get it finished.
